# Coffee-Dataset-Project
EDA project from coffee dataset provided by MICHA≈Å SIKORA on Kaggle.

Background information on the coffee industry: Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world, with an estimated 2.25 billion cups consumed globally each day. The coffee industry has a long history, dating back to the 9th century in Ethiopia. Today, coffee is grown in over 60 countries worldwide and is a major economic driver for many developing countries. However, the coffee industry is also known for its complex supply chains, environmental impact, and issues related to labor and fair trade.

The purpose of this project is to gain insights into the coffee industry by analyzing a dataset on coffee beans and their characteristics, such as variety, region of origin, and price. The goal of this project is to understand the factors that influence the quality, price, and sustainability of coffee beans, as well as to explore trends in the coffee industry.

The Kaggle coffee dataset is a collection of information on coffee beans, including details such as the variety, country of origin, and price. The dataset is sourced from multiple sources and contains a variety of different variables that can be used to analyze the coffee industry. The dataset is available for download on Kaggle and can be used for a variety of different research and analysis projects.
